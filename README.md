# plist-to-alfredsnippets

I recently stumbled upon [Macmoji](https://github.com/warpling/Macmoji) which provides a `.plist` file that you can use to import text replacement snippets into macOS's settings that give you Slack-style emoji usage across your Mac.
Since I'm not a big fan of the default text replacement system and use Alfred's Snippets and [Text Expansion](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/) feature instead.

This Ruby script allows to convert a plist like the one provided on [Macmoji](https://github.com/warpling/Macmoji) to be converted to a `.alfredsnippets` file which can then be imported into Alfred ðŸš€
